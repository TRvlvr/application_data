Most Recent Changes:

Patch UVR_Patch_10_6_23_4_27:
~ MPS for MacOS is now compatible with all MDX-Net & VR Arch models!
~ Fixed memory issue with MDX23C models.
~ Added the ability to choose GPU device to process tracks.
~ Fixed a few graphical bugs.

Other Changes:
~ Added "Vocal Split Mode," a chain ensemble that utilizes karaoke & BVE 
  (backing vocal extractor) models to split vocals into lead vocal and backing vocal 
  stems.
~ Updated "Audio Tools" to include "Matchering".
~ The "Align Tool" has been improved to line up inputs even when there are differences 
in timing, similar to what Utagoe does.
~ Integrated a right-click menu for entries in the batch process window specifically 
  for Matchering & Align tool.
~ Introduced a right-click option for Matchering & Align tool on the main window to 
directly access input folders.
~ Addressed the anomaly where models would self-select in dropdowns.
  ~ This seemed related to having a multitude of models. 
  ~ Revamped the dropdown menus entirely.
~ Fixed splash screen closing issue.
~ Demucs Pre-process Model settings properly reset to default
~ The MP3 encoder now uses LAME.
~ Resolved the problem of using the "MDX23C_D1581" model as a pre-process model for 
  Demucs conversions were leading to a "Key Error: 'Primary Stem'" error.
~ Rectified the "missing file" error that was popping up when trying to convert using 
  the Demucs v2 Demucs model.
~ Solved the problem in Demucs using the htdemucs_6s multi-stem model: when certain 
  stems were selected and pitch-shift conversion was used, a KeyError prevented 
  the stem from being saved. The stem separation now works correctly, and files are 
  saved to the intended destination.
~ Adjusted the "Reset All Settings To Default" function to ensure it also resets the 
  text of the Sample Mode slider.
~ Made corrections so that if you activate Model Test Mode and then restart the app, 
  the "Accept Any Input" option will not be inadvertently enabled.
~ Addressed the ensemble issue with MDX23C models.
~ Updated the "Select Stems" menu for 2 stem models under MDX23C.
~ Revamped the MDXC23 Overlap Menu.
~ Provided an option to decide on using the VR denoise model in MDX-NET.
  ~ Introduced a selection menu with choices: "None," "Standard," and "Denoise Model."
~ Added an option to automatically deverb vocals for Demucs & MDX models. (does not 
  work in ensemble mode at this time)
~ Updated the Download Center to feature MDX23C models.
~ Fixed the glitch where ensemble final outputs weren't saved.
~ Enhanced align/matchering outputs to support MP3 and FLAC.
~ Refined tooltips for "Overlap" and "Segment Default."
~ Ensured the download lists refresh properly even when there's no internet.
~ Many more fixes.
