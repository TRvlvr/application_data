Most Recent Changes:

Patch UVR_Patch_10_6_23_4_27:
~ MPS for MacOS is now compatible with all MDX-Net & VR Arch models!
~ Fixed memory issue with MDX23C models.
~ Added the ability to choose GPU device to process tracks.
~ Fixed a few graphical bugs.

Patch UVR_Patch_1_15_25_22_30_BETA:
~ Tools and Functionalities:
  ~ Phase Swapper Tool: Applies the phase of the reference audio to the target audio.
  ~ Apollo Restore Tool: Restores audio quality by addressing distortions and artifacts 
    from low-bitrate codecs (e.g., MP3s at 32 kbps and above).  
    ~ Note: Not yet compatible with DirectML.
~ Model Enhancements:
  ~ Added support for SCnet, Bandit, and the latest Roformer models (available in the Download Center).
  ~ Added compatibility for Roformer/MDX23C Karaoke Models with the vocal splitter.
  ~ Improved support for secondary model options (unstable with new networks; bugs may occur).
~ Configuration and Usability:
  ~ Introduced a new "Model Installer" for VR Arch, MDX-Net (all networks), and Apollo models.
  ~ Significantly enhanced the model configuration menu:
    ~ Configure settings for multiple models simultaneously.
    ~ Edit YAML configurations directly within the GUI.
  ~ Introduced aliasing for models, allowing users to rename models within UVR without changing
    file names (aliases must fit within the dropdown for a clean interface).
  ~ Improved the "Change Model Settings" menu to auto-populate existing settings, simplifying
    reviews and adjustments.
  ~ Improved convenience by adding an option in the model menus to access model folders directly.
  ~ Resolved silent audio issue for older GPUs by defaulting to Torch's "No Grad" mode instead of 
    "Inference Mode." Users can switch back via advanced Multi-Network options.
  ~ Added the ability to save outputs to the same directory as input.
~ Interface Improvements:
  ~ Ensemble mode model box now includes a horizontal scroller.
  ~ Annoying CMD window no longer pops up during ffmpeg and Rubber Band usage.
